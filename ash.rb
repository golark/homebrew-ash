  # No build dependencies needed for prebuilt binary

  def install
    # Install binary from prebuilt tarball
    bin.install "ash"
    # Install widget scripts for both bash and zsh
    prefix.install "widget.zsh"
    prefix.install "widget.bash"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
    To enable the shell assistant widget (Ctrl+G), add to your shell config:

    For Zsh (~/.zshrc):
      source #{opt_prefix}/widget.zsh

    For Bash (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile):
      source #{opt_prefix}/widget.bash

    Then reload your terminal with: source ~/.zshrc (or source ~/.bashrc)

    Usage: Type a natural language command, press Ctrl+G to convert it.

    Note: On first use, ash will download a ~2GB model to ~/.ash/models/
    This ensures all processing runs locally on your device.

    To uninstall completely:
      brew uninstall ash
      rm -rf ~/.ash/models/  # Remove downloaded model
      # Remove the "source ..." line from your shell config
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Test that ash can be invoked (it will show usage on empty input)
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/ash 2>&1", 1)
    assert_match(/Usage:/, output)
  end
