  def caveats
    <<~EOS
    # On first use, ASH will download a machine learning model locally to ensure all generations run fully on your device (no external API calls).
    # This download may take a little time. Please be patient during the initial setup.
    #
    # To enable the shell assistant widget (Ctrl+G), add to your shell config:
    #
    # For Zsh (~/.zshrc):
    #   source #{opt_prefix}/widget.zsh
    #
    # For Bash (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile):
    #   source #{opt_prefix}/widget.bash
    #
    # Then reload your terminal with: source ~/.zshrc (or source ~/.bashrc)
    #
    # Usage: Type a natural language command, press Ctrl+G to convert it to a shell command.
    #
    # When uninstalling: run "brew uninstall --zap ash" to also remove the downloaded model.
    # Remember to remove the "source ..." line from your shell config file.
